# Aron's Dotfiles
These are the files I use to configure my shell just the way I like it.

Original credit/inspiration goes to Erik Michaels-Ober. Without him, I wouldn't be where I am today.

## Installation
    gem install thor
    git clone git://github.com/ahegyi/dotfiles
    cd dotfiles
    thor dotfiles:install

Before and after installing, try running [thoughtbot's laptop script](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) to set up your comp. Before to get the basics, after to get the stuff in laptop.local.

**Don't forget to set your git username and e-mail in `gitconfig`!

## Inspiration (from @sferik)
These files are an amalgamation of wisdom collected over the years, the sources
of which are too numerous to list. The idea to put them in a repository with an
install script was taken from [Ryan Bates](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles).
